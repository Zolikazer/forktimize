                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong>üôã What‚Äôs This?</strong><br>
                    Forktimize is a simple tool that builds a daily meal plan using food from online food vendors like
                    <strong>CityFood</strong> and <strong><strong>InterFood.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4 has-text-weight-bold">
                    You tell it:
                </p>

                <ul class="has-text-left is-inline-block mb-2">
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Your calorie and macro goals (protein, carbs, fat)</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ Which vendor you want to order from</li>
                    <li>‚Ä¢ What day you're ordering for</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    It goes through the full menu and finds a combination of meals that matches your targets as closely
                    as possible ‚Äî and keeps the cost low as possible.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong>üß© Why Bother?</strong><br>
                    Food vendors have tons of options. If you're trying to hit specific macros, building a good meal
                    plan manually can take a lot of time, guessing, and math.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Forktimize figures it out for you ‚Äî instantly. So if you‚Äôre trying to stay in shape, cut, bulk, or
                    just want a reasonable meal plan without cooking, this might help.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    <strong>üßë‚Äçüíª Who Made This?</strong><br>
                    Just some devs who wanted to have more time live life instead of spending hours planning, grocery
                    shopping and cooking.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    It‚Äôs not a product. It‚Äôs not trying to sell you anything. It‚Äôs just a free tool that does one thing
                    well. Enjoy.
                </p>
